Glyph Deciphering Tool is an app to help out with the proccesss of solving glyph ciphers (ciphers replacing alphabetical letters with a unique glyph image).

Live version is accessible [here](https://digzol.github.io/Glyph-Deciphering-Tool/).

# Instructions
1. Draw a glyph in the top-left corner and add the glyph to the list. Repeat until all known glyphs are added.
2. Use the glyphs to enter a discovered phrase sample. Repeat for each new phrase discovered.
3. Guess the letter association to a glyph based on letter frequencies (e.g. typically 'e' is the most frequent letter in English dialects). Repeat until solved.
